## gindex

This package provides a way to generate the format of index entries from within LaTeX.

What it does is to generate blocks like this for each first-level entry:
```
\setcounter{indexsubitems}{2}%
\indexitem{blah1}{1}%
  \indexsubitem{subblah1}{3}%
  \indexsubitem{subblah2}{5}%
\indexnoitem{}{}%
```

Then you can define `\indexitem` and the like to whatever you want.
